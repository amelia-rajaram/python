# Sustainable Fashion Survey Analysis

## Overview
This project showcases my skills in Python for data cleaning, data manipulation, and data visualization. The dataset used in this project is based on a sustainable fashion survey. I specifically used two sheets from the dataset:

- survey_original data
- survery_questions

## Dataset
The original dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle. You can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mpwolke/sustainable-fashion-survey/input).
